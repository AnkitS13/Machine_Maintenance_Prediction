# Machine_Maintenance_Prediction
## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting whether a machine requires maintenance using features such as air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. The model was developed using a Random Forest Classifier, and a user-friendly Streamlit Dashboard was created to facilitate predictions in real time.

## **Features**
Predicts machine maintenance needs based on operational parameters.
Provides interactive inputs for features using Streamlit widgets.
Displays prediction results along with probability scores for maintenance and no maintenance.
Allows integration of trained machine learning models saved as pickle files.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project includes the following machine features:
Air temperature [K]
Process temperature [K]
Rotational speed [rpm]
Torque [Nm]
Tool wear [min]

Each data point corresponds to a machine's operational state, classified as requiring maintenance or not.

## **Technology Stack**
Python: Programming language for data processing and model development.
Scikit-learn: Used to train the machine learning model.
Streamlit: Framework for creating the interactive dashboard.
Pandas and NumPy: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
